            <h2>A Legacy of Passion and Perfection</h1>
                <p>Café Lumiere was inspired by the vision of our founder’s father, a dedicated barista with a lifelong love for
                    coffee. His passion for crafting the perfect cup is the heart of our café, where every sip tells a story.
                    Rooted in tradition yet infused with innovation, Café Lumiere is more than just a coffee shop—it’s a space
                    where flavors, memories, and creativity come together.
        
                    From hand-selected beans to expertly brewed cups, we honor his legacy by ensuring every coffee we serve
                    reflects the same dedication and care. Whether you’re here for a quick espresso, a slow morning with a
                    latte, or a cozy evening with friends, Café Lumiere welcomes you with open arms.</p>

        <h2>Our Coffee Philosophy</h2>
        <p>We believe that coffee is an art form. That’s why we carefully source high-quality beans, roast them to perfection, and craft each drink with precision. Whether it’s a simple espresso, a velvety latte, or a specialty brew, every cup at Cafe Lumiere is made with the same attention to detail that inspired our beginnings.</p>
       </div>
      <div class="txt">
        <h2>More Than Just Coffee</h2>
        <p>Cafe Lumiere isn’t just about coffee—it’s about community. Our space is designed for everyone: early risers looking for their morning boost, creatives finding inspiration, and friends sharing stories over a cup.
